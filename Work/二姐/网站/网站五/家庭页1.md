##### Energy Management

# Your charging system is now an energy management solution.

Unlock the full potential of your home charger with a Wallbox power meter and our built-in energy management features.

Dynamic Load Management

Dynamic Load Management

Maximize charging speed while staying within your home's power limit. When overall energy consumption is high, charging speed drops. When it's low, you'll charge at maximum speed. That's energy, optimized.

- Avoid fuse tripping
- No costly upgrades or surprise energy bills
- Add a second EV, or more, anytime

Solar Charging

Solar Charging

Harness the full power of your solar panels. Avoid high grid energy prices when you charge your EV with 100% solar energy or a mix of solar and grid energy. The choice is yours.

- Customizable settings
- Sustainable
- Maximized ROI on solar panel installation

### Enjoy +200% more solar charge

Make the most of your solar setup with our new Solar Charging 3P Optimization – intelligently switches your 3-phase Pulsar to 1-phase when enough solar surplus is detected.
