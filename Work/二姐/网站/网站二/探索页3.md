#  Energy Storage

As more solar and wind power comes on line, it becomes increasingly difficult and expensive, to ensure stability of the grid. Intermediate energy storage is therefore rapidly becoming an essential tool to keep power fluctuations on the grid within manageable limits. Moreover, as feed-in tariffs are decreasing, the business case for a home energy storage system that increases self-consumption becomes more solid every day. Intermediate energy storage increases self-consumption of harvested solar and/or wind power. The natural next step is 100% self-consumption and independence from the grid.

Dynamic Energy Storage System is a powerful new feature available for grid-connected Victron Energy installations. It is particularly effective in Europe, for example, where it will save money if your energy provider publishes energy prices for the day ahead – as often happens in Germany and the Netherlands, for example – and it will also […]

A biogas plant producing 500kVA has found that the most cost effective method of providing its own machinery with power is by using solar energy. It is more profitable to sell 100% of the energy it produces to the grid and to install a containerised solution to supply its own power needs in the form […]
