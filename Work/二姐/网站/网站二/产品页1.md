# Charge & Convert

### Charge any battery quickly and safely from any source. Power any load problem-free. Efficiently charge EVs, convert voltages, or isolate shore power.

### Inverter / Chargers

PowerAssist

(Remote) monitoring optional

PowerControl

Ecosystem integration

Combining an inverter and battery charger in one enclosure enables many sophisticated features, such as PowerAssist and PowerControl, that are perfect for mobile, off-grid, backup and energy storage applications. All our inverter/chargers enable charging with solar & wind priority, ESS ready models enable dynamic ESS and so much more. Models with solar chargers built-in are also available for a compact installation.

### DC-DC Converters / Chargers

Built-in SafetyShield+ features

Isolated versions available

Remote on/off connector

(Remote) monitoring optional

DC-DC converters are used to provide power from a DC power source (such as a service battery) to an application of another DC voltage and typically increase (12-24) or decrease (24-12), or stabilise the same voltage (12-12) independently of applied loads or varying input, commonly used for sensitive applications.  
DC-DC chargers increase battery life by adding sophisticated charging features to safely and efficiently charge any battery. Controlled charging will also protect alternators in lithium systems, preventing alternator and battery overload.
