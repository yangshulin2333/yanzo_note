## A greener tomorrow

At Easee, we are committed to not use more of nature’s resources than necessary, and we currently work on our Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) so that we can continually reduce and improve our footprint.

Our products are designed and assembled in Scandinavia and will be an essential part of the future power grid – a power grid that distributes electricity more efficiently and utilises existing capacity in the best possible way.
