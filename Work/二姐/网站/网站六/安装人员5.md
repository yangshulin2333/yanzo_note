![Installer app showing a wireframe of the site overview](https://easee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/installer_app_screen_3.svg)

Add circuits and backplates to existing sites with just a few clicks.

## All you need is the app

Transfer the site data to the backplate by holding your phone over the backplate. With the Installer app, it is even possible to install a complete Easee Ready installation without the need for a Chargeberry. From the Installer app, you can also factory reset a backplate by wiping its data.

## Work offline

The Installer app requires an internet connection to sync all the data to and from the cloud, however you can use the app from a location where there is no internet available like deep within a parking garage, we will make sure to upload all the information to the cloud once you are back online.

## Creating an account

In order to use the installer app you need an Easee account. If you already have an account then all you need to do is sign in. Sign-up can be done right from the app or from the link below.
