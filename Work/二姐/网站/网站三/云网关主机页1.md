Intrusion Detection & Prevention

UniFi’s IDS/IPS guards against potential threats inside and outside the network. This system swiftly detects and blocks suspicious activity that may signal compromise, using a real-time database of known threats.

Advanced  
Segmentation

Smarter security, less complexity. UniFi’s industry-standard Zone-Based Firewall groups networks into LAN, WAN, Guest, and IoT zones so you set policies at scale, not hundreds of rules - streamlining security, reducing errors, and simplifying management.

Application-  
Aware  
Firewall

Accurately detects and blocks traffic directed at specific applications, websites, and IP addresses. Easily block specific targets that might pose security threats at the network, VLAN, and client device level.

Massive Scale  
SD-WAN

UniFi’s license-free Site Magic makes Site-to-Site VPN and SD-WAN setup easier. Instead of complex manual VPNs between gateways, simply choose sites and subnets in UniFi Site Manager at unifi.ui.com.

One-Click WiFi  
& VPN Client

UniFi Identity delivers seamless network and physical access. Grant users permissions and IT access with one click.  
  
With One-Click VPN, users access your network without credentials - no more VPN configuration nightmares.

BGP + OSPF  
Dynamic  
Routing

Full-table BGP picks optimal ISP paths; link failures shift traffic automatically, preserving uptime.  
  
OSPF finds the shortest route and instantly reroutes on failure, keeping the network running.

High Availability  
(Shadow mode VRRP)

VRRP links a second UniFi Cloud Gateway in Shadow Mode; if the primary goes offline, the Shadow instantly takes over, ensuring seamless uptime. Additionally enterprise-class gateways use dual hot-swap power supplies for enchanced reliability.

Multi-WAN +  
SLAs

UniFi Gateways leverage multiple internet links per site for highly-resilient service. Choose between Failover Only mode using a backup internet link or Distributed mode, splitting traffic across links by customizable weighting.

ISP Health  
Monitoring

The UniFi Site Manager dashboard at unifi.ui.com features ISP health metrics for quick, insightful monitoring across sites. Receive real-time email and app alerts for site ISP health, with push notifications settings customizable for each site.

Traffic Flow  
Engine

Monitor, visualize, and audit traffic with detailed flow data and advanced logs. UniFi’s real-time records reveal app usage, IP conversations, and protocol behavior. Built-in logs give event-level activity details - ideal for troubleshooting, compliance, and proactive management.

Content  
Filtering

Block traffic to over 100 categories of malicious, explicit, or unwanted content from your UniFi Network. With just a few clicks, stop traffic to sites linked to spyware, adult content, social media, and more. Content filtering helps you protect users and track attempts to access restricted sites.

Monitoring & PSA  
Integrations (Alarm  
Manager)

Automate and scale network monitoring with alarm manager. Set custom thresholds for key metrics like dropped packets, client disconnections and more. Configure automated responses such as push notifications to specific users, create helpdesk tickets via webhook, or send email alerts.
