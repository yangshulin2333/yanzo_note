# Data Center Infrastructure

Integrated systems for the AI-driven data center

![data-center-infrastructure-hero](https://jabil.com/dam/jcr:fe142ca3-583b-4ba4-aa80-8965de3709a0/data-center-infrastructure-hero.jpg)

The rapid proliferation of AI and advanced computing is transforming how the world works. It’s also driving one of the most significant infrastructure buildouts of our time. To keep pace with accelerating AI workloads, data center platforms are being pushed to their physical and operational limits. What were once discrete compute, [networking](https://jabil.com/industries/networking.html), power, and cooling elements must now function as tightly integrated systems at rack scale. At the same time, hardware providers must manage constant design iteration, compressed deployment timelines, and the growing pressure of fragmented supply chains, tariffs, and geopolitical uncertainty.

Jabil brings [engineering](https://jabil.com/solutions/engineering.html) expertise and global scale to the heart of the data center ecosystem. From manufacturing [wafer fab](https://jabil.com/industries/semiconductor-equipment/wafer-fabrication-equipment.html) and [automated test equipment](https://jabil.com/industries/semiconductor-equipment/advanced-test-equipment.html) for the semiconductor industry, to high-performance compute and networking and [photonics](https://jabil.com/industries/photonics.html) hardware, to integrated power distribution and liquid cooling equipment, we help customer design, build, and deploy full rack-level systems with unmatched speed and precision. 

Whether it's supporting a full platform rollout or a specific integration need, Jabil is a proven partner for bringing next-generation data center visions to life. 

Jabil's System-Level Solutions

### Rack Integration

Jabil delivers integrated data center infrastructure at scale. We don’t just build servers. We engineer and build entire rack-level systems, from compute and storage to switching and photonics, power, and cooling. Our flexible engagement models and global manufacturing footprint help customers accelerate platform deployment, reduce total cost, and future-proof against evolving architectural demands. 

### Our capabilities include:

![factory-rack-integration-services](https://jabil.com/dam/jcr:7a7acd37-86ac-43d1-b5ce-ea1c99db60b2/factory-rack-integration-services.jpg)

![liquid-cooling](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)

### Liquid Cooling

As next-gen processors and accelerators push thermal boundaries, Jabil delivers advanced cooling solutions that enable higher performance, greater density, and reduced energy use across the data center. We tailor rack-scale capabilities to our customers’ unique architecture, integrating liquid cooling at every level, from cold plates to coolant distribution units (CDUs) and manifold designs.

Jabil’s acquisition of [Mikros Technologies](https://www.mikrostechnologies.com/) — an industry leader in microchannel cold plate solutions — broadens our solutions with precision-engineered thermal management optimized for high-wattage compute and AI workloads. Whether you need a standalone solution or a fully integrated system, Jabil is your trusted partner for the cooling system design requirements of today's most powerful applications.

### Our capabilities include:

### Power Management

As data center power demands continue to scale, reliable power distribution and protection are non-negotiable. Jabil’s modular, integrated power solutions enable power from grid to chip, reducing voltage conversion losses and improving power efficiency across data center operations. We engineer, [manufacture](https://jabil.com/solutions/manufacturing.html), and embed directly into rack-level architectures everything from power distribution units (PDUs) and uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems to low- and medium-voltage switchgear. These solutions reduce installation time and customer costs, enabling today’s data center players to step forward into next-gen development cycles with confidence.

### Our capabilities include:
