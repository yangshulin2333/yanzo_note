# Post-Production

Maximizing product value through after-market support and circularity

![Post-Production-Services_Hero](https://jabil.com/dam/jcr:974399cc-1daf-4467-a24b-1b7f6c8d98a5/Post-Production-Services_Hero.jpg)

Supporting products beyond market launch is an opportunity for OEMs to deliver greater value to their customers through smarter service strategies, circular lifecycle management, and sustainability-focused solutions that extend product longevity and reduce negative environmental impact.

With deep expertise in lifecycle planning, we help you make informed decisions that maximize resources and divert waste from landfills. Across industries — including [healthcare](https://jabil.com/industries/healthcare.html), [automotive and transportation](https://jabil.com/industries/automotive-and-transportation.html), [digital commerce and robotics](https://jabil.com/industries/digital-commerce-robotics.html), and [data center infrastructure](https://jabil.com/industries/data-center/data-center-infrastructure.html) — we implement tailored solutions that keep products in use longer and reduce reliance on new materials.

By applying principles like modular design, responsible material sourcing, and strategic supplier collaboration, we make it easier to maintain, upgrade, and recycle products at every stage. Whether through repair, refurbishment, or end-of-life recovery, we ensure your products remain viable, compliant, and aligned with your business priorities and environmental goals.

Jabil can plan for your product’s end of life from the beginning of your engagement with us. Our engineers apply Design for Sustainability (DfS) principles early in the development process, evaluating materials and components to support recycling, responsible disposal, and minimal negative environmental impact. We also leverage a product carbon footprint calculator to develop solutions with a lower cradle-to-gate carbon footprint, often delivering cost savings alongside sustainability benefits.  
  
To further extend product life and reduce waste, we offer a range of recovery solutions, including redeployment, repair, remanufacturing, refurbishment, and reprocessing. These strategies reduce reliance on new materials, divert products from landfills, and limit regulated waste disposal. By prioritizing reuse and recovery of products wherever possible, we help our customers reduce costs while making a measurable, positive impact on the environment.

Jabil offers repair and maintenance services that not only restore functionality but also enhance the performance and extend the lifespan of products. Our services include regular inspections, problem diagnosis, faulty component replacement, and  software updates to ensure reliability over time. To minimize downtime, we also provide spare parts and replacement components, helping to avoid delays caused by supply chain disruptions and eliminating the need to manufacture entirely new products. This approach improves operational efficiency while lowering carbon emissions by reducing the use of virgin materials.

|## **Circular Economy** ![](https://jabil.com/dam/jcr:2212daf8-6f5c-413e-a639-e969597e9777/process_page-0001.2025-08-27-20-28-57.jpg) <br><br>\|   \|<br>\|---\|<br>\||

  
Circular economy refers to a production and consumption model that repurposes materials and components from end-of-life products into new applications, extending resource value and diverting waste from landfills.

Jabil is working to advance circular economy by harvesting components and materials from end-of-life products and transforming waste into recycled raw materials for new designs. Wherever possible, we refurbish existing products and parts to prolong their useful life. 

Our **make-use-recycle** approach reintroduces materials back into the value chain, reduces waste, and minimizes negative environmental impact.
