## Risk Management

Jabil’s solutions help you mitigate supply chain risk through expert forecasting, multi-source strategies, and real-time visibility across global operations. Our approach is built to keep your manufacturing steady, even when conditions shift.

- **Macroeconomic Disruption**   
    Global supply chains are increasingly exposed to a wide array of risks, from global logistics capacity constraints and price fluctuations to geopolitical risks and even extreme weather events — any of which can disrupt the flow of goods. Jabil’s supply chain and procurement teams bring over 50 years of industry expertise to help you forecast scenarios, reduce costs, and ensure reliable delivery. With broad operational capabilities and a focus on multi-sourced components, we reduce reliance on single suppliers and high-risk regions, improving agility across your supply chain.  
     
- **Technological & Market Shifts**  
    Rapid technology advancements and evolving market demands can make legacy products obsolete, and may require businesses to cater to new, unfamiliar territory. Jabil offers an integrated global supply chain with visibility into component availability, end-of-life, and maturity. Our dedicated team of supplier-relationship and global-commodity managers deliver industry knowledge and product-focused, technical solutions that keep you ahead of the game.   
     
- **Visibility & Predictability**  
    Jabil’s advanced technology platforms deliver expert intelligence at market, commodity, and logistics levels. These include our **procurement intelligence platform** for fast, high-quality decision making and our AI-enabled **supply chain orchestration and analytics tools** that provide actionable real-time data insights to reduce inventory costs and strengthen risk management.

Jabil creates customer-specific advanced analytics dashboards that deliver valuable insights across their supply chain, including on-time delivery and carrier performance.
