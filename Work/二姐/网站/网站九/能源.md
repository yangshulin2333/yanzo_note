# Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)

Stabilizing the grid. Scaling the future.

![battery-energy-storage-systems-hero](https://jabil.com/dam/jcr:518bf081-0ffa-48ca-94b7-63205e8dcfda/battery-energy-storage-systems-hero.jpg)

Battery energy storage is the backbone of a more flexible, resilient [energy](https://jabil.com/industries/energy.html) system. As renewable generation expands and the electrification of buildings, transportation, and industry accelerates, BESS plays a critical role not only in storing energy, but also in stabilizing the grid during peak demand.  
  
From residential rooftops to utility-scale deployments, OEMs are increasingly expected to deliver safe, scalable and cost-effective storage solutions. Doing so requires navigating complex technical requirements, evolving safety standards, and regional content mandates, all while accelerating time-to-market. Jabil equips energy storage innovators with the scale, agility, and expertise needed to lead in this dynamic environment.

## Residential Storage

As solar adoption increases, so does the demand for efficient home energy storage. Jabil partners with OEMs to deliver high-volume manufacturing of battery modules, integrated battery management systems (BMS), and thermal management technologies. These systems are designed for safety, reliability, and ease of installation. Jabil’s [automation](https://jabil.com/capability/automation.html) capabilities ensure consistent quality, while its regional production footprint enables customers to meet domestic content requirements and reduce logistics costs.

## Commercial and Industrial (C&I) Storage

C&I energy storage systems must balance performance, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. Jabil delivers modular, scalable [manufacturing](https://jabil.com/solutions/manufacturing.html) solutions for enclosures, power electronics and high-level assemblies. Tailored automation strategies support both semi- and fully automated production, while design-for-manufacturing services reduce complexity and accelerate deployment. Jabil’s [supply chain](https://jabil.com/solutions/supply-chain-management.html) expertise enables customers to manage risk and meet project timelines with confidence.

## Utility-Scale Storage

Grid-scale energy storage systems demand ruggedization, seamless integration, and the ability to scale. Jabil partners with OEMs to deliver containerized system design, thermal, and fire suppression integration and large-format module assembly. Its global network enables localized production and fulfillment, helping customers meet regional compliance requirements and take advantage of market-specific incentives. With deep expertise in power electronics, enclosure fabrication, and system validation, Jabil enables OEMs to deliver at megawatt scale both reliably and efficiently.

## Jabil's Energy Storage Trends Survey

What is the current state and future of energy storage? What challenges do OEMs face in manufacturing and scaling their solutions? To answer these questions and more, we gathered insights from 204 decision-makers at companies that produce ESS and battery solutions.
