# Jabil in the Community

Local action, global impact

![jabil-culture-and-values-hero-b](https://jabil.com/dam/jcr:e14de4c5-799c-48cd-b5a8-08bc617d6d08/jabil-culture-and-values-hero-b.jpg)

Jabil gives back to local communities by creating opportunities for employees to get involved and drive positive change. Through our Jabil Cares community outreach and volunteer program, we empower employees around the world to take action, supporting the causes related to education, empowerment, and the environment that matter most to them.   

Each of our global teams brings its own passion to this mission, implementing a localized strategy that reflects the unique needs and values of their community. 

Throughout the year, Jabil employees worldwide volunteer their time, collaborate with local nonprofits and municipalities, and engage with community leaders to make a difference in the places where they live and work. Their hands-on involvement reflects a shared commitment to compassion, generosity, and purpose — building a better world, one community at a time.

![education](https://jabil.com/dam/jcr:87b87b56-01b8-4ee5-a251-075296d04e97/education.jpg)

## Education

Our commitment to improving education for the next generation includes classroom grants and ensuring students have the resources they need to pursue their interests. Jabil helps equip these future leaders for success by donating books, supplies, and technology, as well as scholarships.   

Beyond the classroom, we invite students to tour our manufacturing sites and explore potential careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). We also support health education and awareness by contributing to and participating in community races, blood drives, and other charitable events.

## Empowerment

To support individuals and communities in need, our empowerment efforts focus on providing opportunities for people with disabilities, uplifting people facing challenges, and tackling issues like food, water, and housing insecurity.  

Jabil Cares also organizes food drives, contributes to affordable housing projects, and offers natural disaster relief.

![environment](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)

## Environment

From beaches to mountain trails, our environmental initiatives enhance the natural beauty of our surroundings and make a positive impact on the planet. Jabil volunteers participate in activities like coastal habitat conservation, litter removal, and recycling programs around the world, aiming to preserve the natural environment for community enjoyment and ecological balance.  

Through partnerships with local organizations, our efforts also include habitat rejuvenation and reforestation to support ecosystems and combat climate change. And by teaching environmental stewardship through workshops and educational events, we strive to ensure a sustainable future for the next generation. 

## The Power of Giving: The Jabil Cares Foundation

The [Jabil Cares Foundation](https://jabil.com/about-us/in-the-community/jabil-cares-foundation.html) is a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) organization of Jabil Inc., which oversees and supports Jabil’s philanthropic initiatives by partnering with nonprofit organizations (foreign and domestic) that support education, empowerment, and the environment in the communities where we operate.

## Living Jabil's Culture

As an employee, you have the chance to make a difference in your local community and be part of something extraordinary. This commitment to making a difference in our communities is a way of life for Jabil employees.
