### Streamline Your Controller Development

- **Sub-headline:** Speed and efficiency are crucial. With our modules, drivers, and validation services you reduce cost and risk while meeting evolving industry standards.
    
- **Accelerate Time-to-Market:** Validated hardware and EVerest integration mean less trial and error, faster results, and more predictable project timelines. Instead of struggling with low-level issues, you can focus on product features and differentiation.
    
- **Efficiency Pillars:** By combining pre-certified modules, drivers, and reference designs, we help you shorten development cycles dramatically, moving from concept to pilot projects in weeks rather than months.
    
- **Reduce Development Costs:** Developing everything from scratch is expensive and risky. With Charger-in-a-Box components, reference boards, and validated drivers, you can avoid redundant work and concentrate resources where they matter most.
    
- **Cost Savings Sources:**
    
    - Fewer redesigns caused by interoperability issues.
        
    - Reduced certification testing time thanks to pre-validation.
        
    - Lower training overhead through workshops and documentation.
        
- **Stay Ahead of Industry Standards:** EV charging standards evolve quickly, from OCPP updates to ISO 15118 extensions and AFIR compliance.
    
- **Regulatory Monitoring:** We monitor regulatory developments closely and implement new requirements into EVerest early. Your controllers are ready for upcoming certifications tomorrow.
    

### Embrace Security and Cyber Resilience

- **Regulatory Context:** The EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) imposes stringent cybersecurity requirements aimed at enhancing security, reliability, and safety.
    
- **Compliance Support:** We support you in preparing for the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), AFIR (Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation), and established communication standards such as OCPP and ISO 15118.
    
- **Security Standards:** We follow industry best practices such as secure coding, module isolation, and cryptographic signing of updates.
    
- **Risk Management:** With our validation and testing services, we help you detect issues early — from hardware interactions to protocol compliance.
