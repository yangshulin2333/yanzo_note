Dedicated Spectral Analyzer Radio

Our AP's feature a dedicated spectral analyzer radio continuously scans your environment, proactively identifying interference to optimize Wi-Fi performance and reliability.

PRISM™ RF  
Filtering

PRISM™ active RF filtering blocks adjacent channel 5 GHz interference to boost SNR. By isolating WiFi channels from nearby noise, it preserves client throughput, range, and stability in crowded RF environments.

MLO  
(Multi-Link  
Operation)

UniFi’s Multi-Link Operation (MLO) intelligently combines multiple Wi-Fi bands simultaneously, maximizing performance, reducing latency, and enhancing reliability for seamless connectivity.

Puncturing

WiFi 7's channel puncturing feature allows a higher-width channel to operate non-continuously and notch out noisy interferers for enhanced client performance.

Coverage  
Visualization

Simplify RF management and maximize Wi-Fi performance. Quickly visualize and optimize channel distribution across your entire deployment, directly within UniFi Site Manager.

Precise Radio  
Controls

Gain complete control of your wireless environment with precise tuning across 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands. Customize channels, widths, and transmit power to match your unique requirements, regional compliance, and performance goals.

Powerful  
VLAN  
Configurations

Instantly update VLAN assignments across thousands of access points, enabling seamless segmentation and enhanced network security—directly through UniFi Site Manager.

Flexible  
Authentication  
Support

Integrate with UniFi Identity for one-click authentication from your source of truth—or use local, AD-based, or cloud-hosted RADIUS. Alternatively, deploy RADIUS directly on your UniFi Gateway.
