# EV Charging 101

Time to demystify the world of electric vehicle charging. We’ve tackled some of the most common questions so you can join the EV revolution with confidence.

### What are the benefits of going electric?

Save money and energy long-term.

Reduce your carbon emissions.

Take advantage of eco-friendly incentives and grants.

Access low emission zones in major cities worldwide.

### Are there different kinds of chargers? Yes! Let's talk about the three most common.

#### Level 1 (Mode 2)

A standard home outlet charger can be directly plugged into the wall and typically requires over 24 hours to finish a full charge. This is usually provided by your vehicle manufacturer.

#### Level 2 (Mode 3)

A Level 2 (Mode 3) charger powers up an EV in just a few hours and often has smart features, making it popular for homes and public spots. Wallbox recommends this option for charging at home.

#### DC Fast Charging

DC charging stations quickly add battery life, getting to 80% in about 30 minutes or even less. These chargers are commonly found in public locations.

### What is a smart charger and why should I use it?

A smart Level 2 (Mode 3) charger offers up to 10x faster charging than a basic Level 1 (Mode 2) charger and has features that let you control when you charge, track your energy use and even protect your home's electrical system. Some smart chargers even let you use solar energy. This is all accessed through an app, like the Wallbox App. 

#### Home Outlet Charger

**Level 1 (Mode 2).** One hour of charge for approximately 15 km of range.

#### Wallbox Smart Charger

**Level 2 (Mode 3).** One hour of charge for between 40 km (7.4 kW) and 120 km (22 kW) of range.

### Will any charger work with my car?

Different cars have different plugs so you'll need to check which is compatible with your vehicle. For AC charging, most EVs in Europe use a Type 2 plug, but you may find a Type 1 or G/BT plug in other parts of the world. Luckily, Wallbox has cable options to satisfy all EVs. In public fast charging locations, you'll find both CCS and CHAdeMO options.

#### How long does it take to charge my car?

This will depend on your EV's battery capacity, the charger type, and grid connectivity. At home, your fastest option is a Level 2 (Mode 3) charger which takes just a few hours.

#### How much will charging cost?

Costs vary depending on location and timing. Public chargers that aren't free of charge (though many are!) will be priced by kWh or time spent. For cost-effective charging at home, choose off-peak hours. 2am to 5am is usually ideal!

### What are the benefits of charging at home and charging on-the-go?

Imagine having a gas station at home. Except this gas station is always open, completely green and you can make sure you're getting the best price by only filling up when it's cheapest. That's home charging! On the other hand, charging at public stations on-the-go means you can travel far from home without range anxiety and charge even faster.

# What should I look for in a home charger?

You may feel that there is a lot to consider when it comes to charging but if you look for these three qualities, you'll be on the right track.

Compatibility

Compatibility

Choose a charger that best serves your car and space. For instance, the Wallbox Pulsar Plus offers two cable types and is compact for tight spaces. With power options from 7.4kW to 22kw, you can choose what's right for you.

Convenience

Convenience

Choose a connected charger that makes charging simple and intuitive. You'll want to be able to schedule charges, keep track of your energy use, and control your charger from anywhere. A fast Level 2 (Mode 3) charger will also make sure your car is charged and ready whenever you need it.

Reliability

Reliability

Your charger should be reliable in all conditions. Choose one that's water and dust resistant (look for IP55 and IK10 labels) and offers both indoor and outdoor installation. A minimum three-year warranty is also a safe bet.

### Do I need to upgrade my electrical installation if I want to install an EV charger at home?

Sometimes, but often not! For example, when using a power meter with your Wallbox charger you can enable Power Boost, which adjusts EV charging speeds based on home power use. This prevents fuse issues and avoids costly electrical upgrades.

#### What is AC charging vs. DC charging?

EVs use two types of electricity: AC and DC. Our grid gives AC, but EV batteries need DC, requiring a conversion, which takes time. With a DC charger, there's no conversion, so charging is much faster.

#### What is bidirectional charging and how can it help me save money?

Bidirectional charging turns your EV into an ultra-powerful battery, with the ability to send energy to your home or the grid. Quasar 2, for example, is a bidirectional charger that can charge and/or pull energy from your EV, opening new opportunities for savings and sustainability.
