### **The Three Common Charger Levels**

- **Level 1 (Mode 2):**
    
    - Standard home outlet charger plugged directly into the wall.
        
    - Typically requires over 24 hours for a full charge.
        
    - Usually provided by the vehicle manufacturer.
        
    - Provides approximately 15 km of range per hour of charge.
        
- **Level 2 (Mode 3):**
    
    - Powers an EV in just a few hours.
        
    - Features smart capabilities for home and public use.
        
    - Recommended by Wallbox for home charging.
        
    - Provides between 40 km (7.4 kW) and 120 km (22 kW) of range per hour of charge.
        
- **DC Fast Charging:**
    
    - Adds battery life quickly, reaching 80% in about 30 minutes or less.
        
    - Commonly found in public locations.
        

### **Smart Charging Capabilities**

- **Speed:** Up to 10x faster than Level 1.
