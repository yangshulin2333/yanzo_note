# Energy. Anytime. Anywhere.

## Designed in the Netherlands.  
Trusted worldwide.

In the early 70s, our founder, Reinout Vader, took apart a dodgy, borrowed inverter and asked himself how he could improve it. His solution started Victron, now one of the world’s foremost developers of power products for marine, RV, off-grid, industrial, and speciality vehicle use.  
  
Engineered to outlast extremes, our open, modular systems provide the freedom to customise and control your energy supply without limits or lock-in. That’s why millions of users worldwide trust us to keep things running, no matter where they are or what they do.

## The best solutions are built with those who depend on them

### We're engineers at heart.

Tech-minded specialists who love perfecting inverter/chargers, batteries, monitoring software, and other power-related products. Not just because we enjoy what we do, but also because we understand the people who depend on what we build.

We connect with the distributors and installers who bring our solutions to life. We relate to the adventurers, technicians, entrepreneurs, and first responders who rely on our products every day.

![Parallax image 5](https://www.victronenergy.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fp5.90b50ce0.jpg&w=3840&q=70)

That’s why we work alongside them instead of for them. Exchanging ideas and feedback, whether online, in noisy workshops, on dusty building sites, or rain-soaked wharves. It’s these honest, technical conversations that make us what we are today: a company with the knowledge to solve any power challenge.

## The Victron way

### Skip the meetings,  
build the solution.

Victron Energy is run like a family of engineers, because it is one. Job titles and corporate structures take a backseat to our mindset: be practical, stay curious, don’t be afraid of mistakes, and keep close to our customers.  
  
We act fast, work open-source, and tackle things head-on, in true engineering spirit. Allowing good ideas to speak for themselves, rather than silencing them with rigid processes. We don’t talk about doing things differently, we just do it. That’s the Victron way.
