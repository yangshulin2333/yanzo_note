# Battery monitors & batteries

### Maximise the potential of our professional batteries with advanced monitoring and management capabilities. Safeguard batteries from excessive discharge and safely combine or isolate them as needed for optimal application performance.

### Batteries

Professional grade

Demanding applications

Victron batteries are perfect for off-grid, marine, RV and industrial systems, delivering superior power and longevity. Our high-speed (dis)charging lithium batteries are ideal for high-demand scenarios and feature impressive battery cycle-life. The range also includes Gel, AGM, lead carbon, telecom batteries and battery balancers to meet various needs.

### Battery monitors

Works with VictronConnect

Remote monitoring optional

High-precision monitors

Common battery types

Our advanced battery monitors track state of charge, time to go and trigger alarms to prevent battery depletion. Compatible with all common battery types and voltages, they use shunt technology for high-precision monitoring. Our battery monitors promote better battery health and optimise system performance by sharing battery voltage and temperature data, enabling synchronised charging and more.

#### Battery Management Systems

Our BMSs monitor and manage lithium batteries, ensuring optimal performance, longevity and safety within the system. They maintain cell balance and protect against overcharging and excessive discharging.

#### BatteryProtect

Battery protectors safeguard your batteries by disconnecting loads before they can drain the battery below a critical level and can also function as a charge interruptor for lithium batteries.

#### Battery isolators and combiners

Battery isolators prevent battery drain and ensure each battery is charged optimally, while combiners merge two parallel DC power sources to supply one critical load output.
