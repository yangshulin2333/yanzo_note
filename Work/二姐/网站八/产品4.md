WHITEPAPER

## Self-Contained Liquid Cooling: Bridging the Gap Between Air & Liquid Cooling

JetCool’s self-contained liquid cooling for servers overcome infrastructure and cost barriers, while bridging the gap between air and liquid-cooled data centers. By eliminating the need for complex liquid cooling infrastructure and **reducing deployment cooling costs by up to 50%**, self-contained liquid cooling emerges as a game-changer for data centers. Moreover, it offers **significant energy savings over air cooling of up to 4kW per rack** by reducing fan speed, resulting in a more efficient cooling solution.
