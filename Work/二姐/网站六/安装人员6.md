Easee Control allows you to manage and keep track of one or more charging sites. Additionally, Easee Control is used to manage your profile and your customer relationship with us. We want you to control our products – not for our products to control you.

## Complete overview of the site

Managing a large charging site can be time-consuming and complex. Easee Control offers all the essential features you need, giving you complete oversight and control of your site. With Easee Control, you can manage EV chargers, set charging prices, monitor the facility’s status, and more. Best of all, Easee Control is free of charge and continuously developed.

### Easee Cloud

Manage your personal account with ease from your Easee Cloud profile. From there, you can access your EV chargers and personal consumption data.

### Charging Site

We have made monitoring your charging site’s load easy. You decide which information you want to view.

### Dashboard

Customize the dashboard to your liking. Keep track of the number of EV chargers currently in use, those that have finished charging, and the amount of power they are consuming.

### Users and Roles

As the administrator of a charging site, you can easily invite users via their phone numbers. Users then manage their own Easee Keys directly from their Easee Cloud profile.

### Consumption

As the administrator, you can view site consumption data per week, month or year for all users and all chargers. Users can access their Easee Cloud profile to view their personal consumption data.

### Reports

Generate detailed reports on charger consumption, users or Easee Keys. The reports will calculate VAT automatically.

## Complete control of every single EV charger

Whenever you need to delve deep into the details of a single charger on a site, Easee Control is the one-stop shop that offers everything you need. Easee Control allows you to check the status of all individual chargers, as well as the WiFi signal, mobile network connection, sofware version etc.
