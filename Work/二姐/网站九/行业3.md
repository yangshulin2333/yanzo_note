# Smart Home & Appliances

Intelligent solutions bring your connected device to market faster

![image](https://jabil.com/dam/jcr:1920859e-bf5f-4c8e-874c-4f603d572d1a/image.png)

Devices within and around the modern home are becoming smarter as they evolve to meet the needs of consumers. These days, a refrigerator can play music, check the weather, give you recipe ideas, and even order groceries. Equipped with cameras, fridges can even allow you to peek inside to see what you need from the grocery store. Your washing machine can suggest the best cycle, wash clothes at the time that’s most convenient, and alert you if there are issues. Products across a diverse range of categories from home gym equipment to pizza ovens and grills are all becoming smarter, with improved connectivity, processing power, and embedded AI.   
  
Yet to profit from this evolution, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) must confront new and difficult technology, manufacturing, and supply chain challenges.  
  
Today’s smart home innovators must consider:

- Connectivity — WiFi, Bluetooth® wireless technology, powerline, Ethernet, and near field communication  
     
- Sensor capabilities — humidity, light, proximity, temperature, and pressure  
     
- Sustainability — recyclability, refurbishment, and waste control  
     
- Ease-of-use — immediate usability, accessibility, and error tolerance  
     
- [Supply chain](https://jabil.com/solutions/supply-chain-management.html) resilience – Network optimization that reduces complexity and improves profitability

## Our Advanced Technologies

## Ki Cordless Technology

Jabil supports brands with the end-to-end integration of the Ki cordless kitchen standard, which allows small kitchen appliances, from juicers to kettles and blenders, to operate without the need for traditional power cords. This innovative standard supports devices that require up to 2.2 KW of power, eliminating clutter and optimizing kitchen space. With Ki technology, appliances like coffee makers are powered when placed on Ki-compatible power transmitters, without the hassle of plugging them in.
