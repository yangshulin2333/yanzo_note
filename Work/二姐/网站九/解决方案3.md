# Manufacturing

Scalable, strategic business models to meet your manufacturing needs 

![manufacturing-hero](https://jabil.com/dam/jcr:3e47cc12-b71b-4c5e-9d1b-99f92dfad7d0/manufacturing-hero.jpg)

One-size-fits-all manufacturing won’t cut it in today’s innovation-driven, hyper-competitive global business landscape. Agility, scale, and speed-to-market are critical. Quality, reliability, and compliance are even more important.

That’s why Jabil offers a full spectrum of manufacturing models tailored to meet your precise production needs now and into the future — no matter where you are in your product journey. Jabil fulfills your requirements with predictable, customized manufacturing solutions, keeping you informed and in control.

Manufacturing Fulfillment Models: The Choice is Yours

- [Prototyping](https://jabil.com/solutions/manufacturing.html#prototyping)
- [Pick to Ship](https://jabil.com/solutions/manufacturing.html#pick-to-ship)
- [Build to Forecast](https://jabil.com/solutions/manufacturing.html#build-to-forecast)
- [Build to Order](https://jabil.com/solutions/manufacturing.html#build-to-order)
- [Configure to Order](https://jabil.com/solutions/manufacturing.html#configure-to-order)

|   |
|---|
|## **Prototyping**![](https://jabil.com/dam/jcr:94b8cee7-ea14-400b-a5ac-d5d92a6c5d3a/cad-to-prototype.2025-08-27-20-21-52.svg) <br><br>\|   \|<br>\|---\|<br>\||

  
Jabil offers quick-turn, high-quality prototyping services tailored for proof of concept, minimum viable product, or design simulations. This approach enables thorough, cost-effective testing and validation, while ensuring a seamless transition to volume production — without incurring the costs associated with finished goods inventory.

|   |

|## **Pick to Ship** ![](https://jabil.com/dam/jcr:f95c14dc-903d-4402-8a86-411627941777/pick-to-ship.2025-08-27-20-21-52.svg) <br><br>\|   \|<br>\|---\|<br>\||

  
The pick-to-ship model is ideal for companies with stable demand that maintain inventories of pre-manufactured goods ready for immediate shipment. Jabil pulls products from stock, packs them, and ships them directly to customer-designated destinations for efficient order fulfillment.

|   |
|---|
|## **Build to Forecast** ![](https://jabil.com/dam/jcr:16de0fe5-c7cf-4300-b8af-7fc355ade84c/build-to-forecast-btf.2025-08-27-20-21-52.svg) <br><br>\|   \|<br>\|---\|<br>\||

  
The build-to-forecast model supports companies with predictable demand by leveraging historical sales data and demand forecasts to guide production volumes. This model enables economies of scale, optimized inventory levels, and faster delivery through pre-planned, bulk manufacturing.

|   |
|---|
|## **Build to Order** ![](https://jabil.com/dam/jcr:f7b1c0ce-bcb7-433d-bc21-22b95fca61a9/build-to-order-bto.2025-08-27-20-21-52.svg) <br><br>\|   \|<br>\|---\|<br>\||

  
In the build-to-order model, product manufacturing begins only after a customer's order is received, making it ideal for companies with highly variable demand. This approach supports smaller, custom production runs and offers cost savings by minimizing inventory at both the subassembly and assembly levels.

|   |
|---|
|## **Configure to Order** ![](https://jabil.com/dam/jcr:9d8fd26c-9d4c-4824-8867-b854b7d5a71e/configure-to-order-cto.2025-08-27-20-21-52.svg) <br><br>\|   \|<br>\|---\|<br>\||

  
Configure-to-order also supports variable demand but typically allows for faster lead times than build-to-order. In this model, Jabil maintains inventories of components or semi-finished products, enabling customers to select features or configurations to meet their unique requirements before final assembly and shipment.
