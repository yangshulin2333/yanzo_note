# Building Automation

Enabling smarter, more responsive buildings

![A business team in a meeting room participating in a video conference with remote colleagues.](https://jabil.com/dam/jcr:5cd26f96-48d0-4e46-b625-41679051adb2/building-automation-hero.jpg)

As expectations rise for comfort, energy efficiency, and seamless user experiences, building automation has become a cornerstone of commercial and industrial environments. From lighting and shading to AV and environmental controls, today’s systems must do more than function; they must integrate and elevate how buildings perform.  
  
To meet these demands, technology providers must deliver smart, connected solutions that are scalable, reliable, and designed to enhance occupant well-being. Jabil supports this mission by [manufacturing](https://jabil.com/solutions/manufacturing.html) advanced automation systems that align with these goals, combining scalability and quality to help customers compete in a rapidly evolving market.

## Audiovisual Conferencing Systems

As hybrid work becomes standard, AV systems are essential to collaboration and productivity across both in-person and remote environments. Jabil manufactures conferencing equipment at scale, including control panels, connectivity hubs, and integrated enclosures that are engineered for reliability, ease of use, and consistent performance.

## Automated Window Solutions

Lighting and shading systems significantly influence both comfort and energy use. Jabil manufactures motorized blinds and smart shading components equipped with embedded controls and wireless connectivity. Its precision assembly processes and globally coordinated supply chain ensure high-quality output and fast delivery to market.

## Environmental and Lighting Controls

Environmental controls are foundational to intelligent buildings, enabling real-time responsiveness and energy optimization. Jabil develops embedded systems and control modules that integrate seamlessly with broader building management platforms, supporting HVAC, lighting, and environmental automation.

## Building Management Interfaces

User experience is central to building performance. Jabil manufactures intuitive control panels, touchscreens and HMI devices that provide occupants and facility managers with greater visibility and control. Design for Manufacturing (DfM) expertise ensures these systems are scalable, reliable, and built for long-term performance.

## From design to delivery, Jabil is proud to partner with many of the world’s leading brands to bring their next-generation technology to market.
