# Engineering

End-to-end engineering expertise that scales with you

![engineering-hero_04](https://jabil.com/dam/jcr:616e6d36-5e7e-42f3-8c8e-23718de62fb4/engineering-hero_04.jpg)

As an engineering-led, [supply chain](https://jabil.com/solutions/supply-chain-management.html)–enabled manufacturing company, Jabil brings deep technical expertise into every phase of product development. With nearly 10,000 engineers worldwide, we work closely with our customers to anticipate and solve their complex design and production challenges — enhancing performance and enabling scalable growth. Our engineering-first approach gives a competitive edge, supported by agile supply chain orchestration and global [manufacturing](https://jabil.com/solutions/manufacturing.html) integration to deliver faster, more resilient solutions across nearly every industry.

Our specialized capabilities span mechanical, electrical, software, optical, and production engineering, along with prototyping, testing, and R&D. We support the full product lifecycle, from early concept development to end-of-life planning, delivering solutions that are innovative, manufacturable, and market-ready.

By engaging early in the development cycle, we help customers assess feasibility, validate new technologies, and ensure every solution is tailored to specific market and user needs. Our expertise is built on a deep understanding of what to make, how to make it, and how to scale it efficiently. With dedicated teams in Design for Excellence (DFx), New Product Introduction (NPI), and sustaining engineering, Jabil delivers fully harmonized solutions by integrating product design with custom equipment and process development.

Whether you're developing low-volume, high-mix products or high-volume, standardized systems, our flexible engagement model adapts to your unique needs. Acting as an extension of your team, we bring the engineering depth, market insight, and rapid execution required to bring your innovations to life.

## EXPERTISE AT SCALE

Our engineering strength is amplified by a globally integrated supply chain, allowing us to tackle complex product challenges.

Engineering Services for Every Stage of Development

![engineering-services](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)

## Engineering, Analysis & VAVE

Our core engineering services are purpose-built to deliver intelligent, efficient, and manufacturable product designs. Leveraging deep expertise in mechanical and electrical engineering, we combine advanced analysis tools with proven value analysis and value engineering (VAVE) methodologies to optimize functionality, reduce costs, and improve quality. 

Through Jabil’s VAVE approach, we enhance value across the bill of materials by simplifying designs, minimizing unnecessary components, and securing the best pricing from high-quality suppliers.

![engineering-analysis-vave](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)

![prototyping](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)

## Prototyping

Our full spectrum of prototyping services — including electrical, mechanical, and optical domains — enable rapid development and accelerate time-to-market. By co-locating prototyping capabilities with engineering teams and integrating them with our manufacturing facilities, we ensure effective collaboration and ensure a smooth transition from design to mass production.

## Verification Testing

We provide rigorous verification testing to ensure products meet the highest standards of performance, reliability, and durability. Our services include system-level verification, accelerated lifetime testing, and environmental simulations that replicate real-world use conditions. 

To further reduce risk and enhance product confidence, we also perform material and process failure analysis, along with component validation to identify and resolve potential issues early in the development cycle.

![verification-testing](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)

![manufacturing-test-development](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)

## Manufacturing Test Development

Our engineering team develops and deploys test strategies that ensure quality throughout the product lifecycle. Our services include test specification development, tester design and deployment, and the execution of structural, functional, and environmental tests in mass production environments.

By integrating test development early in the design process, we create optimized strategies and solutions that minimize risk, drive toward zero defects for our customers, and ensure high-quality outcomes, building greater confidence in every product we deliver.
