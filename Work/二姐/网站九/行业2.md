# Commercial Truck & Bus

Enabling the production of commercial vehicle electronics built for performance, safety, and scale

![Large semi-truck driving on a highway at sunset with fields and trees on each side](https://jabil.com/dam/jcr:937cf527-60a4-4655-8034-bc5393cc6203/commercial-truck-bus-hero.jpg)

The commercial truck and bus industry is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by emissions and safety regulations, as well as the need to improve total cost of ownership (TCO). These pressures are propelling the adoption of commercial vehicle electronics and technologies that enhance energy efficiency, connectivity, intelligence, and safety. 

Jabil’s deep understanding of system requirements and ruggedized applications positions us to successfully launch these technologies to market. Our expertise in commercial vehicle electronics, including driver assistance systems, connectivity and infotainment, and powertrain and compute technologies, uniquely enables us to support the development of next-generation technologies that meet the complex demands of modern commercial vehicles. 

Jabil supports the industry’s traditional high mix, low volume production needs. We partner with our customers to provide flexible design and engineering capabilities, along with industrialization, manufacturing, and specialized supply chain services required to launch new commercial vehicle electronics technologies to market that include:

## Next-Generation Vehicle Technology

Jabil’s comprehensive capabilities support every stage of the product development lifecycle — from ASIL-certified product design and new product introduction (NPI), to supply chain optimization, and automated, high-volume assembly in IATF and VDA-certified facilities. Across these capabilities, we’re enabling vehicle manufacturers to integrate advanced technologies that define the future of commercial trucks and buses.

![Jabil Capabilites web graphics_25_Commercial Vehicle](https://jabil.com/dam/jcr:cd7f734f-8236-4966-ac2a-e3e45ddf5834/Jabil%20Capabilites%20web%20graphics_25_Commercial%20Vehicle.png)

![Advanced Driver Assistance Systems_3](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)

## Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) & Autonomous Vehicles

As ADAS and autonomous technology advance, commercial vehicle electronics must meet higher safety and regulatory standards. Trucks and buses rely on sensors, cameras, radar, LiDAR, and AI-driven systems to reduce accidents, improve driver assistance, and enhance fleet management. Jabil’s [design](https://jabil.com/solutions/engineering.html), development, and [manufacturing](https://jabil.com/solutions/manufacturing.html) solutions ensure high-precision production of optics-based systems for commercial fleets. Our IATF-certified global facilities provide high-quality, high-reliability manufacturing for next-generation ADAS technology.

## Vehicle Connectivity

The rise of connected commercial vehicles is transforming fleet management through real-time data sharing, IoT (Internet of Things) integration, and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. These connectivity solutions optimize fleet efficiency, enhance driver safety, and reduce operational costs. Jabil supports commercial vehicle electronics manufacturers and technology suppliers in delivering scalable, high-quality commercial vehicle electronics for connected mobility platforms, intelligent fleet tracking, and over-the-air (OTA) software updates. 

![Vehicle Connectivity_4](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)

![Power Electrification and Charging_3](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)

## Powertrain Electrification & Charging

Hybrid and electric commercial vehicles are becoming a critical component of the global push for more sustainable transportation. With the growing availability of hybrid and electric models across a range of applications — urban delivery, public transit, and long-haul trucking — businesses are taking advantage of the environmental and economic benefits these vehicles offer. Highly complex, automotive-grade, battery management systems (BMS), inverters, converters, and on-and off-board chargers are required to support this transition from traditional internal combustion engines to electrified powertrains. Jabil’s global IATF- and cleanliness-certified facilities use automated assembly and advanced manufacturing techniques to deliver high-quality, automotive-grade power and [charging](https://jabil.com/industries/energy/power-consumption.html) technology that meets the stringent scale and quality demands of commercial vehicle OEMs.

## Compute and Zonal Controllers

Centralizing the digital architecture of commercial vehicles is a key trend reshaping the industry. As vehicles become more connected, automated, and technologically advanced, manufacturers are adopting a more integrated approach to commercial vehicle electronics, data processing, and control systems. Centralized digital architecture simplifies and streamlines how all the vehicle's digital systems communicate, manage, and process data. This approach offers greater flexibility, improved performance, and easier scalability, which are critical for modern commercial vehicles that rely heavily on advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), telematics, infotainment, and electric powertrains. Jabil’s customers benefit from our unique combination of automotive experience and high-powered compute expertise, to launch their new digital hardware to market at the highest quality and reliability.

![Compute and Zonal Controller_2](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)

## Enabling Tomorrow’s Commercial Vehicle Electronics

Jabil sets the standard for automotive-grade manufacturing of commercial vehicle electronics, providing high-quality, scalable solutions for ADAS, connectivity, electrification, and compute software-defined vehicles. With over 50 years of expertise in design, high-volume manufacturing, and global supply chain management, we help leading commercial truck and bus manufacturers bring cutting-edge technology to market efficiently and cost-effectively.

## From design to delivery, Jabil is proud to partner with many of the world’s leading brands to bring their next generation technology to market.
