01. Concept & Prototyping

### Quickly test and validate new functionality

Start your charger project on a proven foundation: the EVerest open-source stack. Together with our pre-certified DevKits and reference designs, we help you test new concepts rapidly while staying aligned with industry standards from the very beginning.

- Use DevKits and controller boards pre-tested with EVerest to speed up prototyping.
- Validate interoperability with OCPP and ISO 15118 right from the start.
- Focus on your product features instead of building the basics from scratch.

02. Development

### Engineering support at every level

During development, our engineers extend your team and provide the tools you need to move from prototype to production-ready design. We combine deep knowledge of EV standards with hands-on experience from multiple customer projects.

- Driver and framework development for OCPP, ISO 15118, power electronics, metering and more.
- Hardware bring-up and ports to custom platforms, including Yocto Linux.
- Qualification processes, debugging support, and integration testing.
- Guidance on architecture and performance to avoid bottlenecks later.

03. Certification & Compliance

### De-risk your certification process

Navigating standards and certifications can be complex and time-consuming. With pre-certified components and early validation, we reduce uncertainty and shorten approval cycles — so your team can enter the market faster. And we don’t just provide documentation: our engineers actively support you during audits and certification procedures, ensuring that you can demonstrate compliance with confidence.

- Compliance guidance for OCPP 1.6 / 2.0.1 / 2.1, ISO 15118, and AFIR.
- Pre-certified modules reduce testing overhead and integration risk.
- Workshops and direct engineering support prepare your team for audits.

04. Launch & Market Introduction

### From prototype to certified product

The final step is getting your product safely into the field. We support you with system validation, performance testing, and functional safety measures. With our experience, we help minimize risks and secure a smooth launch.

- Final integration testing and validation against real-world scenarios.
- Support for functional safety and cybersecurity requirements.
- Knowledge transfer to ensure your team can maintain and evolve the product.
