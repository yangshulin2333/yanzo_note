# Engineering for Your EV Charging Solutions

From concept to certified product — we help you integrate and extend the EVerest stack, develop hardware drivers, and ensure compliance with global charging standards.

### Accelerate development

Reduce time-to-market with expert driver development and seamless EVerest integration.

### Stay compliant

Meet OCPP, ISO 15118, and AFIR requirements from day one.

### Strengthen your team

Workshops and reviews transfer know-how directly to your engineers.

## Pionix Engineering Services

From concept to certified product, we provide hands-on expertise at every stage of EV charger development. As initiators and core contributors of the open-source EVerest stack, we combine deep technical knowledge with practical experience to make your project a success.

### Consulting & Requirements

Clarify specifications, use cases, and long-term needs before coding starts, reducing risks and enabling efficient planning.

### Driver & Framework Development

We extend EVerest with protocol and hardware drivers (OCPP, ISO 15118, power electronics, metering, isolation monitors, and more) and contribute robust modules for future-proof solutions.

### Hardware Bring-up & Ports

From Yocto Linux to custom platforms: we adapt EVerest to your hardware and ensure smooth bring-up for reliable operation.

### Certification & Compliance

We guide you through AFIR, ISO 15118, and OCPP compliance, streamline testing, and prepare you for audits and certification.

### Workshops & Training

Hands-on workshops, architecture reviews, and secure coding practices build in-house expertise and reduce dependency.

### Lifecycle by Design

Maintainability and testing are part of our engineering approach. We help you avoid technical debt and ensure long-term stability for your products.
