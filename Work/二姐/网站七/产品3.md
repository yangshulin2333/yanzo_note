Charger-in-a-Box

# Pre-certified components and DevKits for faster charger development

Charger-in-a-Box brings together pre-certified hardware and software components from trusted partners validated with EVerest. This lets you accelerate integration, reduce risk, and build on proven designs.  
  
Charger-in-a-Box also allows manufacturers to concentrate on their unique selling points. While relying on validated hardware and APIs, teams can test new charging-related functions in a low-cost, low-risk environment — focusing their resources on differentiation rather than on basics.

### Accelerate development

Ready-to-use DevKits and controller boards jump-start your project.

Our ready-to-use DevKits, tested with EVerest, give you a quick start into charger development. They combine hardware and firmware components in one package, reducing setup time and integration risks.

## Pionix Charger-in-a-Box

Charger-in-a-Box provides pre-certified, ready-to-integrate solutions from our technology partners. Designed to work seamlessly with EVerest, these kits and components help manufacturers shorten development cycles and focus on differentiation.

### Pre-certified with EVerest

All Charger-in-a-Box DevKits and components are validated with the EVerest stack and tested against major charging protocols and standards. This reduces the effort needed for compliance and gives you confidence that your design will interoperate reliably in the field.  
  
By building on pre-certified modules, you can shorten your development cycles and lower certification risk.  
  
And because these components come from a trusted partner ecosystem, you benefit from solutions that are validated not just in the lab, but also in real-world charging scenarios.  
  
This makes Charger-in-a-Box not just a development kit, but a platform for differentiation: freeing manufacturers to focus on their own USPs and customer-facing features.

### Modular architecture

The Charger-in-a-Box ecosystem offers flexible building blocks that can be combined and adapted to different charger designs.  
  
Whether you are prototyping a new controller or scaling up to an entire charging station, modular kits allow you to focus on your unique features instead of reinventing the basics. This adaptability ensures faster time-to-market and easier customization.

### Pre-assembled design

Our DevKits come as ready-to-use hardware packages that integrate essential components into a single, reliable setup. This saves you time in sourcing, assembling, and debugging individual parts, while significantly reducing integration costs. By starting with pre-assembled designs, your team can move quickly from concept to prototype and into production.
