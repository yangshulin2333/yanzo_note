## Controller development made simple

Entering the field of EV charging controller manufacturing can be challenging. Our comprehensive solutions lower the entry hurdles and simplify the journey for embedded system developers.

### Getting started

Pre-certified DevKits and reference boards validated with EVerest allow you to prototype quickly and avoid common pitfalls. Instead of spending weeks sourcing components and testing compatibility you can begin development on a stable foundation from day one.

This reduces the technical risk of early-stage projects and frees your engineers to focus on the unique aspects of your design – not on solving basic interoperability issues. By using proven reference hardware and software, you shorten learning curves and accelerate the transition from concept to prototype.

‍

### Demystifying controller architecture

Developing a charging controller can be complex, with multiple layers of hardware, firmware, and communication protocols. We simplify this process by providing:

- **Documentation and reference designs** for faster orientation and reduced complexity.
- **Workshops and training** to build in-house expertise and help your team work independently.
- **Carrier board examples** that serve as a blueprint for integrating ChargeBridge or custom modules.

This combination significantly reduces integration time and cost, allowing your team to move confidently from prototype to scalable solutions.

### Access expert knowledge

Our engineers bring years of EV charging experience from driver development and hardware bring-up to certification support. This expertise is available to you in a condensed project-oriented format.

Whether you need to implement a new communication protocol, adapt EVerest to a specific hardware platform, or prepare for a certification audit, we provide targeted guidance. By working side by side with your team we ensure that your solutions are not only technically sound but also compliant with OCPP, ISO 15118, AFIR, and upcoming regulations.

The result: robust, reliable controllers that are ready for real-world deployment.

The EVerest project has been demonstrated in pilots around the world to make EV charging far more reliable and reduces the friction and frustration EV drivers have experienced when a charger fails to work or is not continually maintained.

## Streamline your controller development

Speed and efficiency are crucial. With our modules, drivers, and validation services you reduce cost and risk while meeting evolving industry standards.

### Accelerate your time-to-market

Validated hardware and EVerest integration mean less trial and error, faster results, and more predictable project timelines. Instead of struggling with low-level issues, you can focus on product features and differentiation.

By combining pre-certified modules, drivers, and reference designs, we help you shorten development cycles dramatically, moving from concept to pilot projects in weeks rather than months.

‍

### Reduce development costs

Developing everything from scratch is expensive and risky. With Charger-in-a-Box components, reference boards, and validated drivers, you can avoid redundant work and concentrate resources where they matter most.

**Cost savings come from:**

- Fewer redesigns caused by interoperability issues.
- Reduced certification testing time thanks to pre-validation.
- Lower training overhead through workshops and documentation.

This allows you to optimize your budget while still delivering high-quality products.

### Stay ahead of industry standards

EV charging standards evolve quickly, from OCPP updates to ISO 15118 extensions and AFIR compliance. Keeping up with these changes is critical for manufacturers who want their products to remain competitive.

We monitor regulatory developments closely and implement new requirements into EVerest early. That means your controllers are not only compliant today but also ready for upcoming certifications tomorrow. With our engineering support, you avoid late-stage surprises and keep your roadmap aligned with global standards.

## Embrace security and cyber resilience

The EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) imposes stringent cybersecurity requirements, aimed at enhancing the security, reliability, and safety of EV charging infrastructure. We understand the complexities introduced by these new standards and provide reliable solutions – so you can deliver safe, secure and compliant EV charging controllers.

### Ensuring compliance and reliability

Meeting legal and regulatory requirements can be a major challenge. We support you in preparing for:

- **EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)**,
- **AFIR (Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation)**,
- and established communication standards such as OCPP and ISO 15118.

Through workshops, documentation, and direct engineering support, we make sure your product passes certification with confidence. This reduces uncertainty, builds trust with partners, and accelerates your entry into new markets.

‍

### Introducing enhanced security standards

Security is not an afterthought — it is a core requirement for every charging controller. We follow industry best practices such as secure coding, module isolation, and cryptographic signing of updates. By contributing security modules upstream to the EVerest stack, we ensure that your controllers benefit from the latest improvements without requiring constant rework on your side.

This proactive approach helps you avoid vulnerabilities early and gives you a system that is secure by design, not just patched after release.

### Implementing comprehensive risk management

Unidentified risks during development can lead to costly redesigns or even product recalls. With our validation and testing services, we help you detect issues early — from hardware interactions to protocol compliance.

By integrating testing and monitoring into every stage of development, you minimize both technical and business risks. The result is a robust, safe product that stands up to real-world conditions and evolving regulations.
