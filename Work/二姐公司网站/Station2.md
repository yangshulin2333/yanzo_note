# Website Content & Design Specifications

**Reference Model:** [https://www.victronenergy.com/](https://www.victronenergy.com/)

**Scope:** Full Site Architecture (Homepage + Sub-pages)

## 1. Global Navigation (Shared Header)

- **Design Logic:**
    
    - **Tiered Structure:** The header uses a clean, two-tier approach. The **Utility Bar** (Top Right) handles functional tasks (Search, Login, Language) to keep the **Main Navigation** (Primary Left) focused on discovery and product hierarchy.
        
    - **Mega-Menu Implementation:** The "Products" and "Discover" items trigger full-width mega-menus. This is critical for organizing a massive SKU catalog (Inverters, Batteries, Solar) without decluttering the UI. Visual cues (icons or thumbnails) should be used within the menu to aid rapid scanning.
        
- **Content Specs:**
    
    - **Primary Links:** Products, Discover, Downloads, Information, Support, Where to buy.
        
    - **Mega-Menu (Products):** Categorized lists (e.g., "Charge & Convert", "Solar Chargers") paired with a "Featured Product" spotlight (Image + Title) to drive traffic to new releases.
        
    - **Action Groups:** "Where to buy" is visually distinct (often a button style or highlighted link) to serve as the primary global CTA.
        

## 2. Homepage (The Hub)

- **Hero Section:**
    
    - **Layout:** Full-width carousel/slider.
        
    - **H1/Sub-head Logic:** Focus on Brand Promise + Ecosystem ("Independent energy systems engineered to outlast"). Sub-slides focus on specific product launches (e.g., "Orion XS 1400") or features ("Monitor from your watch").
        
    - **Social Proof/Tech:** High-resolution product photography in situ or abstract "Blue Power" tech visuals.
        
- **Feature Modules:**
    
    - **Product Category Grid (Icon-Driven):** A high-visual-weight grid displaying core categories (Solar, Batteries, Monitoring). Uses custom iconography + clear text labels to route users quickly.
        
    - **Case Study Z-Pattern:** A "Stories/Blog" section using a Z-pattern or masonry layout. Content hierarchy: Kicker (Date/Category) -> Headline ("How One Family Built...") -> Excerpt -> "Read More" link. This builds application authority.
        
    - **Ecosystem/Integration Module:** A dedicated block explaining the "System" approach (Hardware + Software). Features a split layout: Schematic/Software UI screenshot on one side, Value Prop copy ("Master any power challenge") on the other.
        
- **Stats/Authority Strip:**
    
    - **Layout:** Minimalist banner.
        
    - **Metric Choices:** "50 Years of Experience," "1 Million+ Users," or similar trust signals.
        
- **Pre-Footer Conversion:**
    
    - **Layout:** Three-column functional triage.
        
    - **Call-to-Action Logic:**
        
        1. **Commercial:** "Where to buy" (Find a dealer).
            
        2. **Support:** "Need advice?" (Link to Support/Community).
            
        3. **Trust:** "Warranty" (5-year standard policy).
            

## 3. Sub-Page Templates (Analyze 3-4 Key Pages)

- **Product/Platform Detail Page:**
    
    - **Hero:** Split layout. Left: High-fidelity Product Image. Right: Title, Key Specs (Voltage, Amperage), and "Download Datasheet" primary action.
        
    - **"How it Works" / System Context:** Crucial section. Does not just show the product in isolation; shows a **System Schematic** (Diagram) illustrating how this Inverter connects to Batteries and Solar Panels.
        
    - **Feature Tabs/Grid:** Technical specifications table (Input voltage range, Efficiency, Dimensions) is mandatory for this audience.
        
    - **Related Products:** "Works best with..." carousel (e.g., showing compatible Cables or Monitors).
        
- **Solutions/Industry Page (e.g., Marine/Automotive):**
    
    - **Case Study Focus:** Hero image features the specific environment (e.g., a yacht).
        
    - **Challenge vs. Solution Structure:** Text blocks outlining specific pain points (e.g., "Limited Shore Power") paired with the Victron solution (e.g., "PowerAssist Technology").
        
    - **Power Profiles:** "Good / Better / Best" or "Small vs. Large Vessel" system configuration examples with links to the required BOM (Bill of Materials).
        
- **Pricing Page:**
    
    - **Design Logic:** **Utility-Focused Download Center**. Unlike standard B2C e-commerce, this page acts as a B2B resource.
        
    - **Layout:** List view of downloadable PDFs/Excel sheets, organized by Quarter (e.g., "2026 Q1 Pricelist") and Currency (EUR/USD/GBP). No generic "Add to Cart" buttons.
        
- **Resources/Support Hub:**
    
    - **Search Logic:** Prominent "Search by Product Name or Serial Number" bar at the top.
        
    - **Documentation Structure:** Filterable library. Users select a category (Inverters) and document type (Manual, Datasheet, Certificate) to dynamically update the file list.
        
    - **Community Integration:** Direct feed or prominent links to the "Victron Community" Q&A forum, acting as a Tier-1 support layer.
        

## 4. Global Footer

- **Design Logic:** SEO-heavy "Fat Footer."
    
- **Navigation Columns:**
    
    1. **Products:** Granular list of top categories.
        
    2. **Discover/Solutions:** Market segments (Marine, Off-grid).
        
    3. **Resources:** Downloads, Software, Warranty.
        
    4. **Company:** Contact, Jobs, Blog.
        
- **Social & Newsletter:** Horizontal strip at the bottom for LinkedIn/Facebook icons and a "Stay Informed" email capture field.
